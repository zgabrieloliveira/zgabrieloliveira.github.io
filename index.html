# Hello, I'm Gabriel 👋

> **Software Engineer specializing in Backend, Distributed Systems, and High-Performance Architectures.**

I am passionate about solving complex engineering problems such as **concurrency**, **resilience**, and **scalability**. My background combines academic research (B.Sc. thesis on Circuit Breakers) with practical experience delivering critical solutions for major energy sector players like Petrobras and EMAE.

Currently, my focus is on architecting robust microservices using **Java (Spring Boot)**, **.NET**, and **Apache Kafka**.
